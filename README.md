Tournament
==========

Currently this is a Python/Flask app that can schedule and keep standings for a round-robin tournament.

This eventually, the plan is that this will be a rich-client AngularJS/Python app that handles Single & Double elimination tournaments, as well as olympic style pool/bracket style tournaments.
