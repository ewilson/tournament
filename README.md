Tournament
==========

This is a JavaScript/Python/Flask app that can schedule and keep standings for a round-robin tournaments. It is currently deployed [here](wilsonericn.com).

Things that I need to add before this is worth anything to anyone besides me:
* Support for single elimination tournaments
* Support for multiple users
* Real authentication/authorization using third party providers
* Reasonable validation of inputs
* Better navigation

Hopefully most of these things can be completed this year.

Things that I hope to add after that:
* Backbone.js -- convert to SPA
* Support for Olympic / World Cup style pool & bracket tournaments
* Support for the concept of a "doubles" tournament

Any thoughts beyond this are far too distant to merit recording publicly.
