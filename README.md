Tournament
==========

This is a JavaScript/jQuery/Python/Flask/SQLite app that can schedule and keep standings for a round-robin "tournaments". 
It is no longer deployed, as it has been replaced by a new version, built with Ember/Django, and found here: 

- [TitleMatch-Web](https://github.com/ewilson/titlematch_web)
- [TitleMatch-API](https://github.com/ewilson/titlematch_api)

I keep this repo here for the historical record.
