Tournament
==========

This is a JavaScript/jQuery/Python/Flask app that can schedule and keep standings for a round-robin tournaments. It is no longer deployed, as it is being replaced by a new version, built with Ember/Django, and found here: 

- [TitleMatch-Web](https://github.com/ewilson/titlematch-web) 
- [TitleMatch-API](https://github.com/ewilson/titlematch-api)

I keep this repo here because the pre-history of the TitleMatch application is mildly interesting to me.
